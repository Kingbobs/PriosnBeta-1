ClassicPrisonCore
===================

This is an archived version of the [@ConflictPE](https://twitter.com/ConflictPE) Networks ClassicPrisonCore plugin. We released our old code to the public
under a permissible open source license in hopes of bettering the community. You may try and run the plugin as-is (although I can pretty much guarantee
it won't work without changes) but we open sourced the code hoping it can help improve existing servers, so feel free to copy & paste.

_Ignore the licence in file headers, this code has been made available under the licence below._
